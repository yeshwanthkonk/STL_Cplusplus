### Next Permutation Inbuilt
    Given an array Arr[], Treat each element of the array as the digit and whole array as the number. 
    Implement the next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the numerically next greater permutation of numbers.
    If such arrangement is not possible, it must be rearranged as the lowest possible order ie, sorted in an ascending order.
